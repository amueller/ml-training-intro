# Linear Models for Regression

![:scale 50%](images/linear_regression_1d.png)

$$\hat{y} = w^T \mathbf{x} + b = \sum_{i=1}^p w_i x_i +b$$

???
Predictions in all linear models for regression are of the form shown here:
It's an inner product of the features with some coefficient or weight vector w, and some
bias or intercept b. In other words, the output is a weighted sum of the inputs, possibly
with a shift. here i runs over the features and x_i is one feature of the data point x.
These models are called linear models because they are linear in the parameters w.
The way I wrote it down here they are also linear in the features x_i. However,
you can replace the features by any non-linear function of the inputs, and it'll
still be a linear model.

There are many differnt linear models for regression, and they all share this
formula for making predictions. The difference between them is in how they
find w and b based on the training data.

---
# Ordinary Least Squares

$$\hat{y} = w^T \mathbf{x} + b = \sum_{i=1}^p w_i x_i +b $$

`$$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p} \sum_{i=1}^p ||w^T\mathbf{x}_i - y_i||^2$$`

Unique solution if $\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{x}_1, ... \mathbf{x}_n)^T$ has full column rank.
???
The most straight-forward solution that goes back to Gauss is ordinary least squares.
In ordinary least squares, find w and b such that the predictions on the training set
are as accurate as possible according the the squared error.
That intuitively makes sense: we want the predictions to be good on the training set.
If there is more samples than features (and the samples span the whole feature space),
then there is a unique solution. The problem is what's called a least squares problem,
which is particularly easy to optimize and get the unique solution to.

However, if there are more features than samples, there are usually many perfect solutions
that lead to 0 error on the training set. Then it's not clear which solution to pick.
Even if there are more samples than features, if there are strong correlations among features
the results might be unstable, and we'll see some examples of that soon.

Before we look at examples, I want to introduce a popular alternative.

---
# Ridge Regression

`$$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p} \sum_{i=1}^n ||w^T\mathbf{x}_i - y_i||^2 + \alpha ||w||^2 $$`

Always has a unique solution.

Tuning parameter alpha.

???
In Ridge regression we add another term to the optimization problem. Not only do we want
to fit the training data well, we also want w to have a small squared l2 norm or squared euclidean norm.
The idea here is that we're decreasing the "slope" along each of the feature by
pushing the coefficients towards zero. This constraings the model to be more simple.

So there are two terms in this optimization problem, which is also called the objective function
of the model: the data fitting term here that wants to be close to the training data
according to the squared norm, and the prenalty or regularization term here that wants w to
have small norm, and that doesn't depend on the data.

Usually these two goals are somewhat opposing. If we made w zero, the second term would be zero,
but the predictions would be bad. So we need to trade off between these two. The trade off is problem
specific and is specified by the user. If we set alpha to zero, we get linear regression, if we set
alpha to infinity we get a constant model. Obviously usually we want something in between.

This is a very typical example of a general principle in machine learning, called
regularized empirical risk minimization.

# (regularized) Empirical Risk Minimization

`$$ min_{f \in F} \sum_{i=1}^n L(f(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i) + \alpha R(f) $$`

???
FIXME pointers data fitting / regularization!

Many models in machine learning, like linear models, SVMs and neural networks follow the general framework of empirical
risk minimization, which you can see here. We formulate the machine learning problem as an optimization problem over
a family of functions. In our case that was the family of linear functions parametrized by w and b.
The minimization problem consists of two parts, the data fitting part and the model complexity part.
The data fitting part says that the predictions mad eby our functions should be accurate according to some loss L.
For our regression problems that was the squared loss.
The model complexity part says that we prefer simple models and penalizes complicated f.
Most machine learning algorithms can be cast into this, with a particular choice of family of functions f,
loss function L and regularizer R.
And most of machine learning theory is build around this framework. People proof for differnt choices
of F and L and R that if you minimize this, you'll be able to generalize well.
And that makes intuitive sense. To do well on the test set, we definitely want to do reasonably well on the training set.
We don't expect that we can do better on a test set than the training set.
But we also want to minimize the performance difference between training and test set.
If we restrict our model to be simple via the regularizer R, we have better chances of the model generalizing.

# Reminder on model complexity

![:scale 80%](images/overfitting_underfitting_cartoon_full.png)

???
I hope this sounds familiar from what we talked about last time. This is a
particular way of dealing with overfitting and underfitting.
For this framework in general, or for ridge regression in particular, trading off the data fitting and the regularization
changes the model complexity.
If we set alpha high we restrict the model, and we will be on the left side of the graph. If we make alpha small,
we allow the model to fit the data more, and we're on the right side of the graph.

# Boston Housing Dataset

Ok after all this pretty abstract talk, let's make this concrete. Let's do some regression on the boston housing dataset.
After the last homework you're hopefully familiar with it. The idea is to predict prices of property in the boston area
in different neighborhoods. This is a dataset from the 70s I think, so everything is pretty cheap.
Most of the features you can see are continuous, with the exception of the charlston river variable which says whether
the neighborhood is on the river.

Keep in mind that this data lives in a 13 dimensional space and these
univariate plots only look at 13 different projections of the data, and can't
capture any of the interactions.

But still we can see that the price clearly depends on some of these variables. It's also pretty clear that the dependency
is non-linear for some of the variables. We'll still start with a linear model, because its a very simple class
of models, and I'd always star approaching any model from the simplest baseline. In this case it's linear regression.
We're having 506 samples and 13 features. We have much more samples than features.
Linear regression should work just fine. Also it's a tiny dataset, so basically anything we'll try will run instantaneously,
which is also good to keep in mind.

Another thing that you can see in this graph is that the features have very
different scales. Here's a box plot that shows that even more clearly.
---

![:scale 80%](images/boston_scaling.png)

???
That's something that will trip up the distance based models
models we talked about last time, as well as the linear models we're talking
about today.  For the penalized models the different scales mean that different
features are penalized differently, which you usually want to avoid. Usually
there is no particular semantics attached to the fact that one feature has
different magnitutes than another.
We could measure something in inches instead of miles, and that would change the outcome of
the model. That's certainly not something we want. A good idea is to scale the data to
get rid of this effect. We'll talk about that and other preprocessing methods in-depth
on Wednesday next week.
Today I'm mostly gonna ignore this. But let's get started with Linear Regression

---
class: middle, spacious


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state=0)

np.mean(cross_val_score(LinearRegression(), X_train, y_train, cv=10))
```
```
0.717
```


```python
np.mean(cross_val_score(Ridge(), X_train, y_train, cv=10))
```
```
0.715
```
???
So here are the

---
# Coefficient of determination R^2

`$$ R^2(y, \hat{y}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2} $$`

`$$ \bar{y} =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} y_i$$`

Can be negative for biased estimators - or the test set!

???

---
# Scaling (if you want)
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
X, y = boston.data, boston.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
ridge = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
ridge.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
```
???
If you want to scale the data, you can use StandardScaler for that.
It makes the mean zero and the standard deviation one. It's an unsupervised
model, so it only takes the data X_train to fit. Fitting just means
computing mean and standard devitation.
Then, we can scale the data using the transform method. Make sure that
you fit the data only on the training set, and then transform the training
and the test set.
If you want to use scaling inside cross-validation, it's a little bit more
tricky. As I said, more details next wednesday. I'm just mentioning this here
because it might come in handy for the homework.

Ok but so let's come back to the Ridge model. Above we just used the default setting
for the parameter alpha, which is one. This is a reasonable default, but there is no reason
why this should give us the optimum generalization performance on this problem.
So it's a good idea to adjust the parameter. As we saw on Monday, we can easily
do that with gridsearchCV.
